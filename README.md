# Holiday-Booking-System-PY-
This is a holiday booking system which I made in Python. It uses JSON for data storage and allows users to browse, book, and manage their holidays
About The Project
This project was created to demonstrate core Python programming skills, including file I/O, data manipulation, and building an interactive user interface on the command line. Instead of a traditional database, it leverages the simplicity and readability of JSON to persist data, making it lightweight and easy to manage.

The system provides a straightforward menu for users to interact with, making it easy to find available holidays, book, and review their plans.

Features
Browse Holidays: View a list of all available holiday packages from the holidays.json file.

Book a Holiday: Select a holiday and book it, creating a new entry in the bookings.json file.

View My Bookings: Display all holidays booked by a specific user.

Cancel a Booking: Remove a previously made booking.

Data Persistence: All holiday and booking information is saved to and read from JSON files, so data is not lost between sessions.
